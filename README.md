# Application: **Solar Age Calculator**

##### By Noah Horwitz

###### _First published 2019-11-15_

## Description:
This project was made as part of a code review for Noah Horwitz, a student at _[Epicodus](http://www.epicodus.com)_, a vocational school for technology careers, based in Portland, OR. The project is designed to create an application that determines a userâ€™s age based on several planets' (Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter) solar years. Then determine how many years a user has left to live on each planet based on an average lifespan. If a user has already surpassed the average life expectancy, return the number of years they have lived past the life expectancy.

The fully deployed project is hosted on GH-Pages [HERE](https://nhhor.github.io/solar-age-calculator).
